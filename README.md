# Microsoft-Dynamics-AX-2012-SQL-Queries
Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 SQL Server Queries for BI and Analytics purposes.  

We will post any scripts that we use for our project. We work for one of biggest retailers in Asia (Over 1500 stores). We spend days to extract queries from X++ and translate those to SQL Server Query so we can use queries for BI and Data warehouse.
